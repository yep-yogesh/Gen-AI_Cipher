# CIPHER

**CIPHER is your AI-powered code companion — a debugger, explainer, and execution simulator all in one.**

It doesn’t just spit out vague answers.  
It **thinks step-by-step**, digs into logic, and delivers **structured insights** that make sense.

Whether you want to debug a tricky snippet, understand code execution flow, or run a dry-run without touching a compiler — **CIPHER’s got your back.**

## Features That Crack the Code

- **DEBUG Mode** → Spot bugs, errors, and logical flaws.  
- **EXPLAIN Mode** → Get human-readable explanations of code.  
- **DRY-RUN Mode** → Walk through execution step by step.  
- **LLM Techniques Built-In** → One-shot, zero-shot, multi-shot, chain-of-thought, structured output.  
- **Token Tracking** → See how much “AI fuel” each request uses.  
- **Dynamic Prompting** → Prompts adapt to your input type (Q&A, long code, translation-like tasks).  
- **Stop Sequences & Sampling Control** → Prevent rambling, tune precision, balance creativity vs. reliability.  
- **Structured JSON Output** → Every analysis comes neatly packaged for dev use.

## How It Works

1. Paste your code snippet.  
2. Pick your mode → `DEBUG` | `EXPLAIN` | `DRY-RUN`.  
3. Watch CIPHER analyze with:  
   - Step-by-step reasoning  
   - Bug reports & fixes  
   - Confidence scoring  
4. Get **clean JSON results** — easy to use in apps, tools, or just for learning.

## Vision

CIPHER isn’t just another code-chatbot.  
It’s your **AI debugging partner**, fluent in programming logic and powered by advanced LLM prompting techniques.

- Beginners → learn code with crystal-clear explanations  
- Developers → catch bugs before they bite  
- Educators → use structured outputs to teach coding step by step  

CIPHER makes AI **think like a coder, not just talk like one.**
